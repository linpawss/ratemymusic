            <div id="popup1"><p> To Pimp a Butterfly is Kendrick Lamar’s second major label studio album, and third full-length project. It was released via Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. It followed his critically-acclaimed 2012 debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city. The album was very well-received upon release, eventually earning 11 Grammy nominations, and it has gone on to be hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.

In contrast to Lamar’s previous projects, TPAB took more heavily from jazz, soul, and funk influences, with such contributors as Thundercat, Terrace Martin, Kamasi Washington, and Flying Lotus providing instrumentation and production. Other noteworthy credits include vocals from Anna Wise, Bilal, George Clinton, James Fauntleroy, Rapsody, Ronald Isley of the The Isley Brothers, Snoop Dogg, and a posthumous appearance from 2Pac.

This album’s concept explores themes of self-love and hate, fame, depression, violence, race, and politics through a spoken-word poem that interweaves between songs, leading up to the climax. The poem is wrapped up on the final track, “Mortal Man,” where it is revealed that Kendrick was reading the poem to 2Pac all along. In an interview with MTV, Kendrick explained that the working title for the album was ‘Tu Pimp a Caterpillar,’ which spells out ‘TuPAC’ when abbreviated. It was changed to ‘butterfly’ in order to symbolize Kendrick’s personal character growth and his overall resiliency following success within the music industry.

The leading singles from this album were the studio version of “i” and “The Blacker the Berry.”

The album was heavily inspired by Lamar’s trip to South Africa in 2014, where he visited historical sites such as Nelson Mandela’s jail cell, birthing recurring motifs like Apartheid, distinctions between African and American culture, or institutionalization, among many others. Kendrick creates many allegorical comparisons between Compton and South Africa, especially on the song “Momma.”

All of Lamar’s efforts, touring, and accolades culminated in a powerful 2016 Grammy Awards performance, featuring “The Blacker The Berry” and “Alright,” for which he famously received undue criticism from FOX News.</p>

                <div id="popup2"><p>OK Computer is the third studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on May 21, 1997. With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.

The album's lyrics depict a dystopian, futuristic world fraught with rampant consumerism, capitalism, social and modern alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.

Despite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police", "Lucky" and "No Surprises" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide.

OK Computer received acclaim and has been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was included by the United States Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". A remastered version with additional tracks, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, was released in 2017, marking the album's twentieth anniversary. In 2019, in response to an internet leak, Radiohead released MiniDiscs [Hacked], comprising hours of additional material.</p>

                <div id="popup3"><p>Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 12 September 1975 through Harvest Records in the UK and Columbia Records in the US, their first for the label. Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.

The album's lyrical themes concern alienation and criticism of the music business. The bulk of the album is taken up by "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", a nine-part tribute to founding member Syd Barrett, who left the band seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health. Barrett coincidentally visited during the album's production in 1975. Like their previous release, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd employed studio effects and synthesisers during recording. Guest singers included Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on "Have a Cigar", and Venetta Fields, who added backing vocals to "Shine On You Crazy Diamond". To promote the album, the band released the double A-side single "Have a Cigar" / "Welcome to the Machine".

Upon its release, Wish You Were Here received mixed reviews from critics, who found its music uninspiring and inferior to the band's previous work. It has retrospectively received critical acclaim, hailed as one of the greatest albums of all time and one of the band's finest works. It was cited by keyboardist Richard Wright and guitarist David Gilmour as their favourite Pink Floyd album.</p>

                <div id="popup4"><p>In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was first released independently on 10 October 2007 as a digital download that customers could order for whatever price they saw fit, including for free. Despite this radical release method, the band actually made more money off this method than they did on their previous release, Hail to the Thief. The band eventually made a standard CD release and a deluxe-edition box set available in most countries during the last week of 2007.

Without a doubt, In Rainbows is one of Radiohead’s most orchestral records. The warm arrangements and sounds gather to create sonic emotions that raised the bar for art rock.</p>

                <div id="popup5"><p>Madvillainy is the only studio album by American hip hop duo Madvillain, consisting of British-American rapper MF Doom and American record producer Madlib. It was released on March 23, 2004, on Stones Throw Records.

The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004. Madlib created most of the instrumentals during a trip to Brazil in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a Boss SP-303 sampler, a turntable, and a tape deck. Fourteen months before the album was released, an unfinished demo version was stolen and leaked onto the internet. Frustrated, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after they had released other solo projects.

While Madvillainy achieved only moderate commercial success, it became one of the best-selling Stones Throw albums. It peaked at number 179 on the US Billboard 200, and attracted attention from media outlets not usually covering hip hop music, including The New Yorker. Madvillainy received widespread critical acclaim for Madlib's production and MF Doom's lyricism, and is regarded as Doom's magnum opus. It has ranked in various publications' lists of all-time greatest albums, including at 411 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at 365 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and at 18 on Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.</p>

                <div id="popup6"><p>In the Court of the Crimson King (subtitled An Observation by King Crimson) is the debut studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 10 October 1969 by Island Records. The album is one of the earliest and most influential of the progressive rock genre, where the band combined the musical influences that rock music was founded upon with elements of jazz, classical, and symphonic music.

Considered by many critics to be one of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time, it reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 28 on the US Billboard 200, where it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p>

                <div id="popup7"><p>Radiohead’s previous album OK Computer (1997) may have introduced experimental elements into their sound, but it didn’t become apparent until its follow-up Kid A was released in 2000. It was recorded following an exhaustive world tour in support of OK Computer, which left many of the band’s members burnt out, especially lead singer Thom Yorke, who nearly suffered a mental breakdown and began having writer’s block. To combat this, the band decided to strip back their sound for their next full-length, sequencing song lyrics at random and incorporating inspiration from krautrock acts such as Can and electronic acts such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. As Yorke himself stated in a 2013 interview:

He burns a heavy shadow… Aphex opened up another world that didn’t involve my fucking electric guitar… I hated the Britpop thing and what was happening in America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he’s kind of my age too.

Many songs from the Kid A sessions were saved for the album’s follow-up Amnesiac, released in 2001, and re-released alongside other unreleased works in the 20th anniversary album Kid A Mnesia (2021).

Kid A debuted at number one on both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, making it the band’s first album to peak at the top of the latter; it was later certified platinum in the UK in its first week of sales. It initially received a mixed to positive response from critics, although some derided the band’s new aesthetic. In the years since its release, however, it has attracted universal acclaim, with Pitchfork, The Times, and Rolling Stone naming it the greatest album of the 2000s, and the latter placing it at number 67 on its updated list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, right above Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall and Led Zeppelin’s Led Zeppelin IV.</p>

                <div id="popup8"><p>good kid, m.A.A.d city is the first major label album by Kendrick Lamar, released on October 22, 2012 through Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.

Subtitled “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,” this concept album depicts a day in the life of a 17-year-old Lamar as he rides around Compton in his Momma’s (Paula Oliver) minivan. Click here to view an in-depth breakdown of the story.

Kendrick revealed the meaning of the title in an interview with L.A. Leakers, saying:

It’s two, two meanings. The first is ‘my angry adolescence divided,’ and the basic standout meaning is ‘my angel’s on angel dust.’ That’s the reason why I don’t smoke,” he said. “That was me. I got laced. The reason I don’t smoke, and it’s in the album. It’s in the story. It was just me getting my hands on the wrong thing at the wrong time, being oblivious to it.

Kendrick summed up his thoughts on the album during an interview with Rap Genius. </p>

                <div id="popup9"><p>loveless is the second studio album by alternative rock band my bloody valentine. loveless was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991 in nineteen recording studios. Lead vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the recording process, seeking to achieve a particular sound for the record using various techniques: guitars strummed with a tremolo bar, sampled drum loops, and obscured vocals. The recording of Loveless is rumored to have cost £250,000, a figure that came close to bankrupting the band’s record label Creation Records.

While Loveless did not achieve great commercial success, the album was well received by critics. Widely regarded as a landmark work of the shoegaze genre, the record has been cited as an influence to several artists, and by critics as one of the best albums of all time.</p>

                <div id="popup10"><p>The eighth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on March 1st, 1973.

It is a concept album that takes listeners across various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat. The themes often revolve around conflict, morality, greed, time, and mental illness.

As a culmination of their inner-space explorations of the early 1970s, the Floyd toured the bulk of Dark Side in Britain for months prior to recording. But in the studio, the band articulated bassist Roger Waters‘ reveries on the madness of everyday life with melodic precision (“Breathe,” “Us and Them”) and cinematic luster (Clare Torry’s guest-vocal aria, “The Great Gig in the Sky”). It’s one of the best-produced rock albums ever, and “Money” may be the only Top 20 hit in 7/4 time.

On May 7th, 1973, they released the album’s first two singles, “Money,” and “Any Colour You Like.”

People often ask me about the voices on Dark Side. I was trying to gather audio snippets to mix into segues on Dark Side. Rather than interviewing people I came up with the idea of writing a series of questions on cards. The cards would be in a stack on a conductors stand in front of a mike. We would scour Abbey Road Studios for willing guinea pigs, bring them to the studio, sit them down, roll tape and then ask them to respond to each card in order. As I recall the first card was something irrelevant and innocuous, like “What’s your favourite colour?” and the last was the more enigmatic “What do you think of The Dark Side Of The Moon?.” I can’t remember the ones in between, except for: “Are you afraid of dying?,” “When were you last violent?,” “Were you in the right?,” “Do you ever think you’re going mad?
If so why?.” End of story.
