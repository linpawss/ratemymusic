            <div id="popup1"><p> In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was first released independently on 10 October 2007 as a digital download that customers could order for whatever price they saw fit, including for free. Despite this radical release method, the band actually made more money off this method than they did on their previous release, Hail to the Thief. The band eventually made a standard CD release and a deluxe-edition box set available in most countries during the last week of 2007.

Without a doubt, In Rainbows is one of Radiohead‚Äôs most orchestral records. The warm arrangements and sounds gather to create sonic emotions that raised the bar for art rock.</p>

                <div id="popup2"><p>Madvillainy is the only studio album by American hip hop duo Madvillain, consisting of British-American rapper MF Doom and American record producer Madlib. It was released on March 23, 2004, on Stones Throw Records.

The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004. Madlib created most of the instrumentals during a trip to Brazil in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a Boss SP-303 sampler, a turntable, and a tape deck. Fourteen months before the album was released, an unfinished demo version was stolen and leaked onto the internet. Frustrated, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after they had released other solo projects.

While Madvillainy achieved only moderate commercial success, it became one of the best-selling Stones Throw albums. It peaked at number 179 on the US Billboard 200, and attracted attention from media outlets not usually covering hip hop music, including The New Yorker. Madvillainy received widespread critical acclaim for Madlib's production and MF Doom's lyricism, and is regarded as Doom's magnum opus. It has ranked in various publications' lists of all-time greatest albums, including at 411 on NME's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at 365 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and at 18 on Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.</p>

                <div id="popup3"><p>Radiohead‚Äôs previous album OK Computer (1997) may have introduced experimental elements into their sound, but it didn‚Äôt become apparent until its follow-up Kid A was released in 2000. It was recorded following an exhaustive world tour in support of OK Computer, which left many of the band‚Äôs members burnt out, especially lead singer Thom Yorke, who nearly suffered a mental breakdown and began having writer‚Äôs block. To combat this, the band decided to strip back their sound for their next full-length, sequencing song lyrics at random and incorporating inspiration from krautrock acts such as Can and electronic acts such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. As Yorke himself stated in a 2013 interview:

He burns a heavy shadow‚Ä¶ Aphex opened up another world that didn‚Äôt involve my fucking electric guitar‚Ä¶ I hated the Britpop thing and what was happening in America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he‚Äôs kind of my age too.

Many songs from the Kid A sessions were saved for the album‚Äôs follow-up Amnesiac, released in 2001, and re-released alongside other unreleased works in the 20th anniversary album Kid A Mnesia (2021).

Kid A debuted at number one on both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, making it the band‚Äôs first album to peak at the top of the latter; it was later certified platinum in the UK in its first week of sales. It initially received a mixed to positive response from critics, although some derided the band‚Äôs new aesthetic. In the years since its release, however, it has attracted universal acclaim, with Pitchfork, The Times, and Rolling Stone naming it the greatest album of the 2000s, and the latter placing it at number 67 on its updated list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, right above Michael Jackson‚Äôs Off the Wall and Led Zeppelin‚Äôs Led Zeppelin IV.

                <div id="popup5"><p>Vespertine is the fourth studio album by Icelandic recording artist Bj√∂rk. It was released on 27 August 2001 in the United Kingdom by One Little Indian Records and in the United States by Elektra Entertainment. Bj√∂rk aspired to create an album with minimal and intricate electronic music to evoke an intimate and domestic feeling, in contrast with the louder styles of her previous studio album Homogenic (1997). She enlisted producers such as Opiate, Console and the duo Matmos, and has also worked with harpist Zeena Parkins. Production on the album began whilst filming her role in Dancer in the Dark.

Bj√∂rk composed arrangements with thin-sounding instruments, including the harp, the celesta, clavichord, strings and custom music boxes. Assisted by Matmos, Bj√∂rk created "microbeats" from various commonplace sounds, such as that of shuffling cards and ice being cracked. Lyrically, the album revolves around Bj√∂rk's new relationship with Matthew Barney, featuring themes of sex and love. Other lyrical sources include the poetry of E. E. Cummings and British playwright Sarah Kane's Crave. Three singles were released from Vespertine: "Hidden Place", "Pagan Poetry", and "Cocoon". The music videos of the latter two were banned on MTV for their depictions of sexuality. Bj√∂rk embarked on the Vespertine World Tour with Parkins, Matmos, and a choir of Inuit women, where they performed at theatres and small venues in favor of acoustics.

The album peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 selling 75,000 copies in its first week and at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified gold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Noted for its erotic, intimate mood and sonic experimentation, Vespertine received universal acclaim from music critics, some have whom considered it Bj√∂rk's best album to date. The album appeared on several publications' lists of the best albums of 2001 and of the decade, and has been evaluated by many critics to be one of the best albums of all time.</p>

It was released on September 11, 2001, through K Records and later through P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd. Recording was done on analog equipment at Dub Narcotic, Olympia, Washington, from May 2000 to March 2001. The album takes influences from numerous music genres such as black metal, ambient and avant-garde, as well as non-musical sources like the American drama television show Twin Peaks and primary member Phil Elverum's relationship to Khaela Maricich. Elverum was responsible for the album's production in its entirety.

Musically, The Glow Pt. 2 diverts from the band's previous studio release It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water, and features experimental production, alongside musical techniques and lyrics that often reference nature and the Pacific Northwest. For promotion, Elverum embarked on The Paper Opera Tour with Calvin Johnson and Khaela Maricich, before going on a solo tour of North America. In the years following its release, the album has been reissued multiple times, with the first in 2007 including a disc of bonus material. An immediate critical success, it has since appeared in multiple rankings of the best albums of the 2000s, and is considered by many music critics to be the Microphones' best work and an important release in the lo-fi genre.</p>

                <div id="popup7"><p>The College Dropout is the debut studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records. In the years leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded the album over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.

The production of The College Dropout was primarily handled by West and showcased his "chipmunk soul" musical style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; the album also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher education.

The College Dropout debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was a large-scale commercial success, becoming West's best-selling album in the United States at the time, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014 and was certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020. The album was promoted with singles such as "Through the Wire", "Jesus Walks", "All Falls Down", and "Slow Jamz", the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, with "Slow Jamz" becoming West's first number-one single as a lead artist.

A widespread critical success, The College Dropout was praised for West's production, humorous and emotional raps, and the music's balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities. The album earned the rapper several accolades, including nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the 2005 Grammy Awards, winning for the latter. It has since been named by numerous publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, including Rolling Stone and NME, who ranked it at 74 and 273 respectively on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists, and is credited for popularizing the chipmunk soul and conscious rap subgenres in the 2000s.</p>

                <div id="popup8"><p>Mm..Food (stylized in all caps) is the fifth studio album by British-American rapper and producer MF Doom, released by Rhymesayers in November 2004. The album peaked at number 17 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart, and number 9 on Heatseekers Albums chart. The title Mm..Food is an anagram of "MF Doom".<br>
                MF Doom described Mm..Food as a concept album "about the things you find on a picnic, or at a picnic table". The album's titles and lyrics contain references to different foods, some with common metaphors and double entendres in the "street world" and the "nutritional realm".

The album is primarily produced by MF Doom, except for the tracks "Potholderz", produced by Count Bass D; "One Beer", produced by Madlib and originally intended for the joint Madlib and MF Doom album Madvillainy; and "Kon Queso" produced by PNS of Molemen. Mm..Food features guest appearances from Count Bass D, Angelika, 4ize and Mr. Fantastik.

                <div id="popup9"><p>Illinois (styled Sufjan Stevens Invites You to: Come on Feel the Illinoise on the cover; sometimes spelled as Illinoise) is a 2005 concept album by American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens. His fifth studio album, it features songs referencing places, events, and persons related to the U.S. state of Illinois. Illinois is Stevens' second based on a U.S. state‚Äîpart of a planned series of fifty that began with the 2003 album Michigan and that Stevens has since acknowledged was a joke.

Stevens recorded and produced the album at multiple venues in New York City using low-fidelity studio equipment and a variety of instruments between late 2004 and early 2005. The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state‚ÄîStevens developed them after analyzing criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following its release, Stevens promoted Illinois with a world tour.

Critics praised the album for its well-written lyrics and complex orchestrations. In particular, reviewers noted Stevens' progress as a songwriter since the release of Michigan. Illinois was named the best-reviewed album of 2005 by review aggregator Metacritic, and was included on several reviewers' "best of the decade" lists‚Äîincluding those of Paste, NPR, and Rolling Stone. The album amounted to Stevens' greatest public success to date; it was his first to place on the Billboard 200, and it topped the Billboard list of "Heatseekers Albums". The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by Steve Reich, Neil Young, and the Cure. Besides numerous references to Illinois, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith.</p>

                <div id="popup10"><p>Deathconsciousness is the debut studio album by American rock duo Have a Nice Life, released on January 24, 2008 on Enemies List Home Recordings. Recorded independently by the band members on a budget of less than $1,000, Deathconsciousness was released as a double album; the first disc is entitled "The Plow That Broke the Plains" and the second is entitled "The Future". The original cover art features a darkened version of the painting The Death of Marat, painted by Jacques-Louis David in 1793.

The album received little attention from professional music publications upon its release, but spread through internet message boards and memes. In 2019, Kerrang! noted that it "quickly became a viral hit amongst internet communities like /mu/, Sputnikmusic, Album of The Year, and Rate Your Music. Aided by their relative anonymity and Deathconsciousness‚Äô ominous liner notes, which described a fictional medieval cult that worshipped God‚Äôs murderer, Deathconciousness quickly became the stuff of internet myth."
