            <div id="popup1"><p> To Pimp a Butterfly is Kendrick Lamar’s second major label studio album, and third full-length project. It was released via Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. It followed his critically-acclaimed 2012 debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city. The album was very well-received upon release, eventually earning 11 Grammy nominations, and it has gone on to be hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.

In contrast to Lamar’s previous projects, TPAB took more heavily from jazz, soul, and funk influences, with such contributors as Thundercat, Terrace Martin, Kamasi Washington, and Flying Lotus providing instrumentation and production. Other noteworthy credits include vocals from Anna Wise, Bilal, George Clinton, James Fauntleroy, Rapsody, Ronald Isley of the The Isley Brothers, Snoop Dogg, and a posthumous appearance from 2Pac.

This album’s concept explores themes of self-love and hate, fame, depression, violence, race, and politics through a spoken-word poem that interweaves between songs, leading up to the climax. The poem is wrapped up on the final track, “Mortal Man,” where it is revealed that Kendrick was reading the poem to 2Pac all along. In an interview with MTV, Kendrick explained that the working title for the album was ‘Tu Pimp a Caterpillar,’ which spells out ‘TuPAC’ when abbreviated. It was changed to ‘butterfly’ in order to symbolize Kendrick’s personal character growth and his overall resiliency following success within the music industry.

The leading singles from this album were the studio version of “i” and “The Blacker the Berry.”

The album was heavily inspired by Lamar’s trip to South Africa in 2014, where he visited historical sites such as Nelson Mandela’s jail cell, birthing recurring motifs like Apartheid, distinctions between African and American culture, or institutionalization, among many others. Kendrick creates many allegorical comparisons between Compton and South Africa, especially on the song “Momma.”

All of Lamar’s efforts, touring, and accolades culminated in a powerful 2016 Grammy Awards performance, featuring “The Blacker The Berry” and “Alright,” for which he famously received undue criticism from FOX News.</p>

Subtitled “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar,” this concept album depicts a day in the life of a 17-year-old Lamar as he rides around Compton in his Momma’s (Paula Oliver) minivan. Click here to view an in-depth breakdown of the story.

Kendrick revealed the meaning of the title in an interview with L.A. Leakers, saying:

It’s two, two meanings. The first is ‘my angry adolescence divided,’ and the basic standout meaning is ‘my angel’s on angel dust.’ That’s the reason why I don’t smoke,” he said. “That was me. I got laced. The reason I don’t smoke, and it’s in the album. It’s in the story. It was just me getting my hands on the wrong thing at the wrong time, being oblivious to it.

Kendrick summed up his thoughts on the album during an interview with Rap Genius. </p>

Widely acclaimed by both fans and critics, it received a near impossible 10/10 rating from Pitchfork Media. Several of its songs, along with the record itself, appeared on numerous “best of 2010” lists, and the album won the 2012 Grammy for Best Rap Album.

It received a 94/100 score on Metacritic and later appeared on numerous greatest albums ever made lists.

                <div id="popup4"><p>Upon its release, Death Grips' debut studio album became their magnum opus. The Money Store instantly marked an evolutionary step forward in experimental, industrial, and underground hip-hop.

Death Grips created one of the most innovative musical releases of the decade through utilization of the trio’s individual and collective strengths: MC Ride’s raw, visceral, and abrasive vocals; Andy “Flatlander” Morin’s distorted, mechanical sonics; and Zach Hill’s explosive drumming style, coupled with his adept creative direction.

The lyrics create a bleak, dystopian atmosphere, with Ride’s cryptic wordplay and intense delivery setting the scene for a dark future. Despite these factors, the album manages to be supremely catchy with its combination of infectious earworm hooks and upbeat, experimental production.

Despite a rocky release—10 days prior, several songs from the album were leaked over YouTube and Soundcloud—The Money Store achieved critical acclaim, boasting a decisive 81/100 on Metacritic, and notably receiving internet music critic Anthony Fantano’s first ever 10/10 score.</p>

                <div id="popup5"><p>The album shares the name of J.G. Ballard’s 1970 novel and Joy Division’s 1980 track. Both were quite controversial following their release with references to a Third World War and JFK’s assassination in the novel, and the lead singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, subsequently committing suicide.

Danny stated that another meaning of the album is more literal. People treat usually disturbing things like his drug habits or police brutality as though they are part of a freak-show:

When they see anything happen… like say police or anything that’s violent that’s happening, instead of them trying to fix the situation, what do they do? They pull they phone out and try to record it… We living in an atrocity exhibition.</p>

                <div id="popup6"><p>IGOR (pronounced EEE-GORE), released on May 17, 2019, is Tyler, the Creator’s sixth studio album. The announcement of the album came after some speculations the week before, followed by the release of four snippets on Tyler, The Creator’s social media platforms.

The album contains features from artists such as Kanye West, Charlie Wilson, CeeLo Green, Solange, Lil Uzi Vert, and Playboi Carti and includes numerous vocal samples from comedian Jerrod Carmichael, although none are credited as features.

Thematically, IGOR’s arc describes a love story: falling madly in love but eventually breaking it off and accepting that the relationship is over while attempting to remain friends.

The album received a GRAMMY Award for “Best Rap Album” at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards. This choice stirred up some controversy, as some believed that the album should not be considered a rap album and the nomination was racially motivated. Tyler himself stated his frustrations during a Radio Room Interview after the GRAMMYs:

I’m very grateful that what I made could just be acknowledged in a world like this. But also, it sucks that whenever we, and I mean guys that look like me, do anything that’s genre-bending, they always put it in a ‘rap’ or ‘urban’ category. […] Why can’t we just be in pop?

The album was voted the Genius community’s Best Album of 2019, surpassing Ariana Grande’s thank u, next and Billie Eilish’s WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?.</p>

                <div id="popup7"><p>Blonde is the second studio album by the enigmatic Frank Ocean. The album was released on August 20, 2016, following a four-year hiatus after the release of channel ORANGE. The album was released both physically, in magazines given away in pop-up stores around the country, and digitally on iTunes. The magazine, titled Boys Don’t Cry, is a companion piece to Blonde and features various types of content including poetry and interviews from Frank himself. The magazine also features an alternate version of Blonde.

On August 20, 2016 the lead single “Nikes”, was released with an accompanying music video exclusively on Apple Music.
One aspect of the album that has been subject to much discussion is the title. Specifically, the reason why the title is spelled differently on the album cover. Fans have speculated that the use of “blond” on the album cover and “blonde” on the album listing is a reference to Frank’s bisexuality and the themes of duality between masculinity and femininity in his life; with “blond” being the masculine form, and “blonde” being the feminine.

The word “blonde” itself holds two interpretations. The first is that children normally have blonde hair that darkens to brown as they get older. Blonde can therefore be seen as a reflection of Frank’s younger years, detailing his innocence and purity and loss thereof, making the album play out as more autobiographical than any of his previous works. Songs such as “Pink + White” and “Ivy” recall Ocean’s coming-of-age through the use of vocal pitching. The second interpretation is the symbolism of blonde hair; blondes are considered to be thoughtless and carefree. In a Tumblr post on the album, Frank stated that he drew inspiration from a picture of a blonde child in the back of a car. Her “clear and calm” eyes echo the album’s theme of immortality and youthful carelessness. The closing track “Futura Free” is about the freedom of being able to move forward, a celebration of Frank’s newfound independence.

The album’s concept explores heavily on falling in and out of love; themes of self-love and hate, failed relationships, family, drugs, and depression can be found throughout. These themes intertwine to create a complex and nuanced project, which stands as Ocean’s most vulnerable. In contrast to Frank’s previous albums, Blonde takes on a more minimalist approach with influences such as Elliott Smith, Pharrell Williams, David Bowie and James Blake to name a few. The album has an eclectic and atmospheric feel, with drifting guitars and beatless melodies accompanying dense and powerful lyricism. The Observer characterized the album as “cerebral, non-macho, boundary-free R&B.”</p>

                <div id="popup8"><p>Blackstar (stylised as ★) is the 25th, and last, studio album by David Bowie. It was officially released on January 8, 2016.

This 7-track album was released under ISO Records, and was entirely recorded in the studio known as “The Magic Shop.” David Bowie & Tony Visconti are the producers of the album, and it features percussion (performed by James Murphy).

Visconti stated that he and Bowie listened to “a lot” of Kendrick Lamar, specifically his second LP, To Pimp a Butterfly while working on the album. He told Rolling Stone:

We wound up with nothing like that, but we loved the fact that Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn’t do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that’s exactly what we wanted to do. The goal, in many, many ways, was to avoid rock & roll.

The album was met with universal acclaim from music critics. Rolling Stone critic David Fricke described the album as “a ricochet of textural eccentricity and pictorial-shrapnel writing.” Andy Gill of The Independent regarded the record as “the most extreme album of his Bowie’s entire career,” stating that “Blackstar is as far as he’s strayed from pop.”

On the 10th of January, (only 2 days after the album was released), the legend himself, David Bowie died at the age of 69 in Manhattan, New York after battling cancer in secret for 18 months. Since we were presented with the sad news of his unfortunate death, several have looked deeper into the album and noticed that Blackstar explores the theme of mortality.</p>

                <div id="popup9"><p>Carrie & Lowell is the 7th Studio Album, by Singer-Songwriter Sufjan Stevens. Sparsely instrumental, Stevens marks a return to his indie folk roots. Carrie & Lowell since its release has gained universal acclaim, with many critics calling it Steven’s finest work yet. Many songs were inspired by the passing of his mother, Carrie, in 2012, as well as his stepfather, Lowell.

Stevens released a live version of the album and a mixtape of outtakes and remixes in 2017.</p>

                <div id="popup10"><p>To Be Kind is the thirteenth studio album by American experimental rock band Swans, released on May 12, 2014. It was released as a triple LP, a double CD, and a two-CD deluxe edition that includes a live DVD of performances from Hellfest Open Air Festival, Pitchfork Music Festival and Primavera Sound Festival, as well as a digital download.
                Critical reception of the album was very positive, continuing a string of well-received albums from the band. The album peaked at number 37 on US Billboard 200, and debuted at number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. Both are the highest chartings that Swans had ever achieved on a studio album and it is the first time that the band cracked the top 40 in both countries.
