            <div id="popup1"><p> SCARING THE HOES is the first collaborative album between American rapper and producer, JPEGMAFIA, and Detroit native, Danny Brown. This is the follow-up to JPEG’s 2021 album LP! and Danny’s 2019 album uknowhatimsayin¿.

The 14-track album only features one guest appearance by up-and-coming Maryland artist, redveil. Along with Peggy’s extravagant production on the entire album, he mentioned on Twitter that he made every song’s beat on a SP 404, quoting:

Made every beat on the album with one machine, The SP 404. wanted to see what its like to make music with one machine.

On May 2, 2022, early hints of the project were confirmed by Peggy at the Smoker’s Club Festival, when he brought Danny to his set and they both performed a new song together. Danny told an excited crowd:

So yeah, Danny Brown and JPEGMAFIA album. Y’all just heard the first song, coming soon. […] Motherfuckers get ready for Peggy and Danny, bitch. I’m out!

A fragment of the album’s sixth song “Burfict!” was heard for the first time on NTS Radio on March 28, 2022.

During the following months, both artists shared some photos of them together in the studio. It wouldn’t be until January 10, 2023 where Peggy would announce that the album was entirely finished. Almost a month later, on February 18, 2023, Danny brought Peggy as a guest to his show, The Danny Brown Show. Both talked more in-depth about the project and previewed what would be the first promotional song from the album, “Lean Beef Patty,” which released a month later, on March 13, 2023. On the same day of the single’s release, both artists announced the tracklist and artwork of their upcoming album.

The second promotional track and title track of the album, “SCARING THE HOES” was announced and released one week after the first promotional single, on March 21, 2023.</p>

                <div id="popup2"><p>Javelin is the ninth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Sufjan Stevens. It is his first solo album of new material since 2020’s The Ascension and his first in full solo “singer-songwriter mode” since 2015’s Carrie & Lowell.

Sufjan dedicated the album to his late partner Evans Richardson IV, who had passed away on April 30, 2023.

Sonically, the 10 tracks that make up the album amalgamate Stevens' 25-year career, through elements such as choir, orchestral, acoustic, and electronic experiments.

The album was announced on August 14, 2023 along with its lead single, the quiet “So You Are Tired”.

In addition to writing, producing and playing most of the instruments, Sufjan is the author of all the graphic work that accompanies the album, including the cover and the 48-page book with collages and essays.</p>

The album was supported by two singles, an abnormal occurrence for woods, who typically releases his albums with little promotional push. The two singles were “FaceTime” (released April 12, 2023) and “Soft Landing” (released May 3, 2023).

The album thematically is focused on traveling. As stated himself “Maps is a story of the road, or roads, taken and untaken; of living the dream and dreaming of another life. It is an album about trying to find your way home, after making your home wherever you lay your head.”

“Kenny and I made more songs together before Hiding Places than we did after,” woods says. “I think we only collaborated once over the last four years and although we didn’t talk about it, I think we wanted to let that energy build again. Neither of us wanted to make Hiding Places 2. We needed to go on other journeys, artistic and otherwise, to come back and do something fresh.”</p>

The album’s first single, “Free Yourself,” was released on 19 July, 2022. After a few months passed with no new releases or album-related news, Jessie began to tease fans in January 2023 by putting up promotional posters on a few billboards around London. People were quick to realise what was happening and Jessie soon sent a newsletter to her fans in which she wrote:

If you’re in London, you may have seen my visage on a few billboards. It got a load of you talking, debating what was happening. It was a little cruel to keep quiet (but also very fun to see you discuss) and to be honest, you’re all very good inspector gadgets, fantastic faithfuls, perfect poirots!

Jessie announced on 7 February, 2023 that the second single, “Pearls,” would be released in two days. On 9 February, 2023, the tracklist and the album’s release date were revealed, as well as the official cover artwork.</p>

Sometimes rough and other times delicate, Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!? is a journey into the psyche of McKinley Dixon, with all of the attendant peaks and valleys. “I’m aiming for making my stories accessible,” he says, “while also still keeping it to the heart of what I love.”</p>

What happens when a genre inspired by the hollowness of branding itself becomes a brand? Over the last few years, George Clanton’s 100% Electronica label has carried forward the momentum of a decade of vaporwave, taking the genre offline, launching festivals and merchandise, and minting an overall more consumer-friendly presentation of a sound once confined to the most baffling corridors of the internet. Though he’s remained a constant ringleader, Clanton himself has been relatively quiet in terms of output, only dropping the occasional loose single and a collaborative album with the frontman of 311. As his profile continued to rise, it remained to be seen how he would eventually follow up his invigorating 2018 debut, Slide.</p>

                <div id="popup9"><p>Though his work pre-dates the last decade, it was in the 2010s that Austin Lunn’s solo project entitled Panopticon became one of the best black metal bands currently operating. From the raw, political charge of Kentucky, through the rangy, transitory Roads to the North, to the delicacy and melodicism of Autumn Eternal,1 Panopticon fuses American heritage with Nordic musicality into an extremely compelling and atmospheric black metal package. The new decade brought …and Again into the Light which was a typically dynamic and emotively-driven affair and it’s now followed by The Rime of Memory.</p>

                <div id="popup10"><p>Jeff Rosenstock doesn’t want your money. In the 2000s, as the mastermind of Bomb the Music Industry!, he turned down record label offers, gave away his music for free, and spraypainted his fans’ shirts instead of selling merch at shows. With an ethos equally indebted to the militant anti-consumerism of Fugazi and the fraternity of Less Than Jake, the jack-of-all-trades has long believed DIY is the only answer. “Not only do I think it’s sustainable, I can’t imagine how else to do it,” Rosenstock said before the band’s hiatus. This spirit has remained consistent during his solo career, but as the Emmy-nominated musician stared down 40, he stopped refusing financial assistance and accepted a fancy studio session to record HELLMODE, his fifth solo album, at the behest of Polyvinyl.</p>
