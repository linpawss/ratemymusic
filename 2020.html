Almost a month later, on February 18, 2023, Danny brought Peggy as a guest to his show, The Danny Brown Show. Both talked more in-depth about the project and previewed what would be the first promotional song from the album, “Lean Beef Patty,” which released a month later, on March 13, 2023. On the same day of the single’s release, both artists announced the tracklist and artwork of their upcoming album.

The second promotional track and title track of the album, “SCARING THE HOES” was announced and released one week after the first promotional single, on March 21, 2023.</p>

                <div id="popup8"><p>Javelin is the ninth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Sufjan Stevens. It is his first solo album of new material since 2020’s The Ascension and his first in full solo “singer-songwriter mode” since 2015’s Carrie & Lowell.

Sufjan dedicated the album to his late partner Evans Richardson IV, who had passed away on April 30, 2023.

Sonically, the 10 tracks that make up the album amalgamate Stevens' 25-year career, through elements such as choir, orchestral, acoustic, and electronic experiments.

The album was announced on August 14, 2023 along with its lead single, the quiet “So You Are Tired”.

In addition to writing, producing and playing most of the instruments, Sufjan is the author of all the graphic work that accompanies the album, including the cover and the 48-page book with collages and essays.</p>

                <div id="popup9"><p>Windswept Adan (アダンの風, Adan no Kaze) is the seventh studio album by Japanese folk singer and guitarist Ichiko Aoba. It was released via her label Hermine on December 2, 2020. Windswept Adan marked a departure from Aoba's previously minimalist guitar instrumentation, instead using chamber folk instrumentation such as a string quartet, harp, flute, woodwinds and piano, as well as field recordings of nature. The album's music was composed and arranged in collaboration with Taro Umebayashi. Aoba described the album as a "soundtrack to a fictional movie" set on the fictional islands of Kirinaki and Adan, based on the Ryukyu Islands in Japan.</p>
